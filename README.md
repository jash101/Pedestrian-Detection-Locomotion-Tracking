# Pedestrian-Detection-Locomotion-Tracking

A repository for _MATLAB GUI_ application to interface with Arduino (Uno) using the add on 'Hardware Support Package for Arduino'.
(__Note:__ Make sure you download and install the mentioned add-on in order to make the code run)

## Features:
1. Detect forces incident on the piezoelectric panels, which are connected to the analog pins on the Arduino board.
2. Filter out the inputs by whitelisting for a certain range and increasing the count.
3. Store the data in a  CSV file.
4. Display __'Virtual Heat Map'__ for the panels along with the count. The panel displays colors from blue through red, depending upon the count.
5. Clicking the panels leads to opening a new window which displays __Time vs Weight plot__ and individual panel counts for the complete run time, using the CSV files.
